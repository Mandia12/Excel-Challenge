Crowdfunding Written Analysis:

Conclusions:

The contents of this data do not present any obvious or significant trend in either successful or failed crowdfunding campaigns. However, there are some potentially important details.
The theater parent category has significantly more crowdfunding attempts. However, the ratio between outcomes is relatively similar to other categories.
Outcomes of campaigns do not vary much throughout the course of a year’s time. 
Of all 1000 instances of data, 565 of them were successful campaigns.
Although it represents a minor portion of our data set (4 instances), the only parent category with a campaign success rate of 100% is the journalism category.

In an attempt to succeed with crowdfunding a project, the data provides several conclusions. First, it is not beneficial to engage in unnecessary expenditure of time or effort in finding which category of project to create or when, during the course of a year, the campaign should begin. Next, there is a 56.6% chance of success. Lastly, a project under the journalism category will most likely provide the best results. 


Limitations and Suggestions:

One limitation of the data is the absence of a project’s other marketing strategies. Obtaining some information on the marketing practices of a project could potentially provide information on whether a correlation exists between their marketing attempts besides the campaign itself, and number of backers.  

A suggestion to extract more knowledge would be to see how much time a campaign was given to reach its goal and if there is a correlation to the outcomes. This could be done with a standard line graph. Moreover, creating a bar graph that compares outcomes to campaigns with and without the spotlight could provide useful information as well.
